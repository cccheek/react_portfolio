# REACT PORTFOLIO

Hi! My name is Claire and this is my React Portfolio. I am a baby web dev that has nearly completed a full-time full-stack Coding Bootcamp through University of Washington. It's been absolutely insane, but I am soooo excited to finish out strong with Project 3! I am so excited for my future following this program. This has been without a doubt one of the hardest things I have ever done, but I have enjoyed (nearly) every moment of it. I have had the pleasure of meeting some lovely and incredibly intelligent people and I will cherish these memories for the rest of my life.
